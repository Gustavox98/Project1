                        <p>I had immigrated to the United States when I had 14 years old looking for a better life and future. When I started college, I wasn’t sure what I wanted to do in life but with some friends I made in college they helped me chose the computer science field. I decided to choose this path because everything we use daily must involve computer. I like to learn new stuff every day. I’m looking forward to getting to work together and get things done the best way.
